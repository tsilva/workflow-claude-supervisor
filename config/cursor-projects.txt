# Cursor Project Priority List
# ============================
# List your project directory names in priority order (one per line).
# When you press Alt+C, Cursor windows are arranged across workspaces
# starting at workspace 2, following this order.
#
# Projects listed first get lower workspace numbers for faster access.
# Any Cursor windows not matching these names are placed in subsequent workspaces.
#
# Example:
my-main-project
api-backend
web-frontend
mobile-app
shared-library
docs-site
experimental
